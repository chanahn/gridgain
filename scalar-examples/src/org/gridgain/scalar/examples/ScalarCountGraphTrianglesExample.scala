/**
 * Example shows how can GridGain be used to count triangles in undirectional graph.
 *
 * It first creates adjacency list graph representation and puts it in cache.
 * Adjacency list for each vertex is referenced by vertex number.
 *
 * Then computation and data collocation is used to process each vertex without
 * unnecessary data transfers. For each vertex we know all its neighbors (stored in
 * adjacency list), so we can generate a list of all possible edges that can complete
 * a triangle. If edge exists, triangle exists too (e.g., if vertex '3' is connected to
 * vertices '5' and '8' and edge (5 -> 8) exists, they form a triangle).
 *
 * Reduce step is trivial - we just summarize results for all vertices to get
 * total number of triangles in graph.
 *
 * Remote nodes should always be started with configuration file which includes
 * cache: `'ggstart.sh examples/config/spring-cache.xml'`.
