/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of GridGain grid configured with Spring.
 * <p>
 * String "Hello World." is printed out by Callable passed into
 * the executor service provided by Grid. This statement could be printed
 * out on any node in the grid.
 * <p>
 * The major point of this example is to show grid injection by Spring
 * framework. Grid bean is described in spring-bean.xml file and instantiated
 * by Spring context. Once application completed its execution Spring will
 * apply grid bean destructor and stop the grid.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Starting Remote Nodes</h1>
 * To try this example you should (but don't have to) start remote grid instances.
 * You can start as many as you like by executing the following script:
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh}</pre>
 * Once remote instances are started, you can execute this example from
 * Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans (and any other Java IDE) by simply hitting run
 * button. You will see that all nodes discover each other and
 * some of the nodes will participate in task execution (check node
 * output).
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Spring Configuration</h1>
 * This example uses spring-bean.xml file which one can find in examples/config directory.
