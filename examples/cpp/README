C++ client examples README

BUILD THE CLIENT LIBRARY
=========================

Follow the instructions in clients/cpp/README file for how to build the client library.

RUNNING
========

* Configuring log

You can control the client's log level by setting the GRIDGAIN_CPP_CLIENT_LOG_LEVEL environment
variable to one of the following values:
1 (error),
2 (warning),
3 (info), and
4 (debug).

By default, the log level is 3. The client sends all its log messages to stdout.


* Running the client examples

First, build the examples by going into the examples/cpp directory and executing the following
commands:

> ./configure
> make

On Windows you can use the provided Visual Studio solution (in the vsproject/ directory) to
compile the examples code.

Before you can run the examples, you must ensure that the org.gridgain.examples.client
package are available on the GridGain node's classpath. One way to achieve that is to build
the jar containing the examples code and drop it to the $GRIDGAIN_HOME/libs/ext directory.
When the ggstart script runs it automatically picks up the jars from that directory.

Now you can start a GridGain node as follows:

> $GRIDGAIN_HOME/./bin/ggstart.{sh,bat} examples/config/spring-cache.xml

Alternatively you can run an instance of <c>GridClientExampleNodeStartup</c> java class which
will start up a GridGain node with proper configuration.

Once the GridGain node is up and running you can run the examples:

> ./gridgain-example

If you just compiled the client library make sure that you ran 'ldconfig' to update library cache
before running the example.

Feel free to modify the example source code to change communication protocol from TCP
(default) to HTTP and try other options.
