/**
 * ==Overview==
 * Defines Scalar "pimp" for `GridProjection` on Java side.
 *
 * Essentially this class extends Java `GridProjection` interface with Scala specific
 * API adapters using primarily implicit conversions defined in `ScalarConversions` object. What
 * it means is that you can use functions defined in this class on object
 * of Java `GridProjection` type. Scala will automatically (implicitly) convert it into
 * Scalar's pimp and replace the original call with a call on that pimp.
 *
 * Note that Scalar provide extensive library of implicit conversion between Java and
 * Scala GridGain counterparts in `ScalarConversions` object
 *
 * ==Suffix '$' In Names==
 * Symbol `$` is used in names when they conflict with the names in the base Java class
 * that Scala pimp is shadowing or with Java package name that your Scala code is importing.
 * Instead of giving two different names to the same function we've decided to simply mark
 * Scala's side method with `$` suffix.
